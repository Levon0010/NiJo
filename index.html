    <h2>Why we hate Nivid Joshi</h2>
    <p class="hate">Ever since NiJo has been elected as head boy he has been terrorizing everyone under his regime. NiJo is not only a terrible head boy, he roams around the school like he owns it. NiJo is the kind of person who is a discord moderator and thinks it's a real job. NiJo is a dumb person who sits on his butt watching OTT all day while his mother is out picking up groceries. There are several NiJo anecdotes which prove that he is a terrible personÂ andÂ aÂ headboy. We will not let NiJo's cruel regime hinder us. He is a failure whu chose to brib everyne to make him hedboy so he can escape school, he samelesly bribed many students to make him hedboy, while the deserving candidates humiliatingly los. itll be a miracl if he broght mor than 80% in his eksams.</p>
